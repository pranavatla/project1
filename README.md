# project1

|Introduction|
 This Git repository serves as a platform to showcase my ongoing journey in DevOps. Here, I implement the skills I acquire, highlighting the technologies and tools integral to the DevOps process.

|Project Goals|
 My primary goal is to develop a WebApp enriched with automation and an array of technologies, mirroring the expertise of a seasoned DevOps professional. Key objectives include:
	-Creating a WebApp with AWS integration
	-Managing server operations, including package installations (e.g., nginx and apache) on EC2 and other VMs.
	-Exploring and implementing DevSecOps principles for enhanced security.

|Technologies Used|
 Throughout this project, I've harnessed a range of technologies and tools, including:
	-Linux Commands (utilized in the Macbook terminal)
	-Microsoft Visual Studio Code
	-Vagrant and VirtualBox for VM creation and automation of SSH key management.
	-AWS services (EC2, VCS, EIP, SG, and more).
	-GitHub for version control.
	-Docker for containerization.
	-MongoDB, mongo-express, and Node.js for WebApp development.
	-Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
	-Sourcetree for version control management (beginner level).

|Challenges Faced|
 Every challenge encountered in this project became an invaluable lesson. Notable hurdles included navigating complex network configurations and gaining proficiency in SSH for seamless VM connectivity. Each obstacle served as a catalyst for learning and growth.

|Current Developments|
 I've made strides in my DevOps journey, including:
	Creating a local WebApp using Docker and VS Code. (with plans to migrate it to the EC2 instance for web access)
	Mapping an EC2 instance to https://project.atla.in/. (Ongoing work to make the WebApp accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS)
	Preparations to incorporate additional features into the webpage.
	Developed a main.tf for Terraform containing script for 2 EC2s with name, security config and IP output upon execution. (master:/project/main.tf)

|Next Steps|
 My roadmap for the future includes:
	Completing the migration of the WebApp to the mapped EC2 instance.
	Ensuring the website is accessible through both HTTP and HTTPS.
	Enhancing the functionality of the WebApp.
	Continued exploration of DevSecOps principles.
	Deepening my understanding of Terraform and Sourcetree.
	Expanding my expertise in AWS services.
